This is an audio broadcast program (under development).

Version 0.1, the first version.
Developed by Yuqi Liu, Xidian University.
Finished on Jul 12, 2011.

The program is intended for simulating the broadcast system of the old Shijiazhuang Railway Station, which will stop functioning since Dec 21, 2012.

This program is not working properly yet! I named it the first version because it managed to read the data file (written in ASCII text) properly. I have never tried to read lots of characters in an ASCII file, and with several trials and attempts, I finally made it. This version is to specify my little achievement in programming~~

Station Master V0.1 is written in the C Programming language, gcc compiler enabled.

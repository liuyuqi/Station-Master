This is an audio broadcast program (under development).

Version 0.2
Developed by Yuqi Liu, Xidian University.
Finished on Jul 26, 2011.

The program is intended for simulating the broadcast system of the old Shijiazhuang Railway Station, which will stop functioning since Dec 21, 2012.

Version 0.2 is beginning to work !
However, there are no GUI or sound effects, as I intended to bring into this program.

***********************
After then, I started to work for Xidian OpenSource Community, as well as prepare for GRE and TOEFL iBT test, program suspended till present.
I will continue working on this project from Jan, 2013.

从2011年7月26日至今，该项目暂停。我开始为西电开源社区近乎全职工作一个多月。从10月13日开始，我走上了准备GRE和托福考试的征程。
2012年12月21日，铁路既有石家庄客站将停用，新石家庄客站将开启。在这之后的一段时间里，我争取继续这个项目，把广播的基本功能实现，以此纪念百年石家庄客站。

Station Master V0.2 is written in the C Programming language, gcc compiler enabled.
